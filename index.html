 <h1>Rose Anne Gallus</h1>

 <h2>Summary</h2>

 <p>I have been in the IT business for 30 years.  I have traveled extensively
   providing consulting services in various industries.  I have worked as a Business Analyst
 and also in the Process Improvement arena.</p>

<h2>Goals and Dreams</h2>
<p>My ideal goal is to share and educate those in the world.  Share the beauty of nature
   and educate on the importance of conservation.  Without education the slaughter of species
   will continue impacting our environment.</p>


<p> I have worked for Safari Camera's unlimited for 20 years in Kenya.  This business catered
   to the rich and famous.  After years of putting up with this bullshit, I moved to
   South Africa and opened my own business.</p>
